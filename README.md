This is a CSS based radial progress display based upon the work of Anders Ingemann from his examples 
located at https://medium.com/@andsens/radial-progress-indicator-using-css-a917b80c43f9

Iâ€™ve tried to simplify the HTML needed by removing the redundant <span> entries and using 
the ::after style tag to insert content dynamically. 

I hope this helps others who are looking for a great looking CSS based radial progress indicator.
